It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart

你一开口 就正合我意 这就是神奇的默契

without saying a word you can light up the dark

不言一语 就足以把黑暗驱离

try as I may I could never explain

我千方百计 竟也道不出这种魔力

what I hear when you don't say a thing

就算静谧无言 我也能听到的天籁之语

the smile on your face lets me know that you need me

你脸上的笑意 让我笃定需要我的人是你

there's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me

你眼眸流转的真情 向我诉说你会不离不弃

the touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall

你掌心传来的温度 会在我跌倒时把我扶起

you say it best when you say nothing at all

一切尽在不言中 有此默契足矣

All day long I can hear people talking aloud

整夜整日 充斥耳膜的都是人声鼎沸

but when you hold me near you drown out the crowd

但当你靠近我时 万籁倾刻静寂

Old Mr. Webster could never define

韦伯老先生(美国词典编纂家)都没法说清这种感觉

what's been said between your heart and mine

不知道咱们虽然身无彩凤 但却心有灵犀

the smile on your face lets me know that you need me

你脸上的笑意 让我笃定需要我的人是你

there's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me

你眼眸中流转的真情 向我诉说着你会不离不弃

the touch of your hand says you'll catch me wherever I fall

你手掌传来的温度 会在我跌倒时把我扶起

you say it best when you say nothing at all

一切尽在不言中 有此默契足矣

When You Say Nothing At All

有情何须开口言
